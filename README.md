# PneumoniaDiagnosisML

Pneumonia is a serious condition characterized by inflammation of the lungs. It is a major cause of hospitalization, with about 1 million adults seeking care in hospitals per year in the US alone. A key aspect for a good recovery is early diagnosis, permitting the administration of drugs before the infection gets too severe. With this in mind, this project aims to classify X-rays from patients into normal vs pneumonia. In order to reach a high accuracy, we will use a deep learning model, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

To reach this goal, we will follow these steps:
1) Import and Prepare the Data
2) Build the CNN using Keras and fit it to our data
3) Evaluate the accuracy of our model
